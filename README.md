# BabyNames
A web scraper that graphs the number of babies given a particular name in the US throughout the last 100 years


This project focuses on the application of dictionaries to two types of data: counts of baby names in the U.S. by year, and counts of names referenced in literature by year. Our goal will be to produce a visualization that fuses these two data sources together.
